## Cannabis Tracker Deployment - 2025-09-09 21:43

**Objective:** Deploy the `cannabis-tracker-v2.tsx` React application.

**Initial State:**
- A single React component file `cannabis-tracker-v2.tsx` exists on the Desktop.
- No `package.json` or project structure is present.

**Actions Taken:**
1.  **Project Initialization:**
    - Created a `package.json` file with necessary dependencies for a Create React App project, including `react`, `react-dom`, `react-scripts`, `lucide-react`, and `recharts`.
    - Added standard scripts for `start`, `build`, `test`, and `eject`.
2.  **Configuration:**
    - Created a `.gitignore` file to exclude `node_modules`, build artifacts, and environment files from version control.
    - Created a `tailwind.config.js` to enable Tailwind CSS.
    - Created a `netlify.toml` file to specify build commands for deployment.
3.  **Documentation:**
    - Created this `dev_documentation.txt` file to log the setup and deployment process.
4.  **Project Structure:**
    - Created `public` and `src` directories.
    - Added a standard `public/index.html`.
    - Moved `cannabis-tracker-v2.tsx` to `src/App.tsx`.
    - Created `src/index.tsx`, `src/index.css`, and `src/reportWebVitals.ts` to complete the React app structure.
5.  **Dependency Installation:**
    - Ran `npm install` to download all project dependencies.
6.  **Project Organization:**
    - Created a `cannabis-tracker-app` directory.
    - Moved all project files into the `cannabis-tracker-app` directory to resolve deployment pathing issues.
